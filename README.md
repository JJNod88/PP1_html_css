# My 5-A-Side


# Introduction
Welcome to My 5-A-Side

A site for footballers looking for a new game, new players to add to their squad or a place they can create and manage a 5-A-Side Team in Manchester, UK.

It is designed for people looking for a good blend of social and fitness activities. Everyone is welcome and has access to the available games in their area. 

The site will be targeted toward people who have a keen interest in football, socialising and keeping fit. The site provides details of the benefits of joining, gives them the ability to check the next avaialble games, meet existing teams and a sign up section.

I have used real world teams and players, including images to give the site authenticity, and to connect with users and members.

## UX
###Â Structure
* For the site I have used HTML for the core structure and CSS for styling -
    * HTML structuring:
        * My structure includes three pages, each with: Header & Nav > Sections with headers, divs and additional elements > Footer & Nav.
        * Whilst I followed the industry standard for a core html structure, I used Flexboxes to structure my content throughout.  
        * This proved extremely beneficial in structuring each section. I used no more than 3 divs per section using display:flex, this meant each section is positioned equally in either 100%, 50% or 33% divs. This increases the visual consistency and display of my content, and allowed my elements to be aligned.
        * I ensured I correctly linked my CSS stylesheet (checked using the background color technique) with appropriate SEO key words so my site is searchable on the internet.
        * Because of the way I structured my site, I was able to duplicate many of my html elements into new pages. This was great for time saving and consistency.
    * CSS
        * I created an asset folder that held my style.css sheet which allowed me to style many pages at once. I linked this in to the html using rel and href attributes 
        * Images were kept in the Asset folder under an inserted Images folder, this ensured there would always be an image there, without the risk of an external owner closing a website or authorisations. 
            * I used Pexels for the background and form image, this is a free image site that requires no consent. My other image for the Location section was taken by myself. 
        * Some of my pictures needed scaling. I used the free site promo.com to rescale, and compressor.io to reduce the size of my image files. 

### Site layout
* The site has been designed to be simple, effective and easy to navigate. 
    * Layout
        * My site consists of a landing page with content, a commutiy page with content, and a sign up page with a form. 
        * Each page is divided into sections of equal size (unless it affected the look of the site, i.e the opening section for the background image)
        * Headings and Images are specific.
        * Each section has been designed to sell, provide information and direct the user to the product. 
        * For my background color I used rgba 0.1 green, which allows for content to be easily visible and also minimilistic whilst the green matched the theme of a football site. I have seperated sections using the standard white background color or Images.
    * Navigation 
        * I have used lots of naviation in my site, to allow users to navigate the site with ease.
            * A visible header, with a position:sticky and Z-index of 999 means it is always accessible and visible. The title and three page navs link to all aspects of the site. 
                * This is the same for the Footer.
            * In my icons I have added href links to the appropriate sections and pages. An example of this is the 'how' icons on the index page. They direct to sign up and to the available game section. I have also used :hover elements to make them stand out and easier to click on. 
            * My buttons have links, and also stand out with red backgrounds. I have also used :hover elements to make them stand out and easier to click on. 
    * Font size, color, type and styling:
        * Font color has been standardised to dark green, designed to be clearly visible, consistent and following the football theme color.
        * Font sizing has been duplicated where possible. This includes appropriate proportions for icons vs their text, all headers on each page the same size and font. Have used % to icnrease responsiveness.
        * Font Type was imported from Google Fonts, I chose Roboto and Lora with a back up sans Serif. This gave headings and their text meaning and provides a foundation font should the google fonts ever be unreadable on a browser. 
        * I used font styling across the site. This includes font spacing for (header) and line heights (p's and addresses) to make text easier to read.

# Accessibility
* The site is accessible to Users who may have a disability that prevents them from accessing the site in certain ways.
    * the foundation of this is the site layout and semantic HTML elements.
        * The Page is layed out with a standard HTML format to improve its flow, allowing screen readers to indicate header, nav, section, heading, p, ul, form and footer elements of the site. 
        * Using these Semantic Elements in the correct order provides additional functionality for tab keys and screen readers.
    * UI Controls - Nav bar is set to Float Left so that you can use the tab to navigate it accurately. All buttons are accessible using the keyboard tab and enter functions.
    * For the form, I have used labels and linked them to inputs so that a screen reader can distinguish each field.
    * To ensure I have provided enough information for any links in my site, I have added aria-label outlinining the purpose of the link, and have used brackets if it is taking the person to a new tab.
    * All images that have been added to the CSS stylesheet, have corresponding alt attributes with concise text in the corresponding body of its html. 
    
# Responsiveness
* Structure:
    * I used FlexBox to structure my elements which is an extremely responsive way of structuring the site. With display:flex and flex:1 for example, all of my sections and divs were automatically positioned correctly, and did so when scaling your screen size up or down. This saves a lot of time and looks great!
* % units:
    * Across the site I have used % for sizing. This inclused in height, width, padding, margins and font-sizes etc. I implemented this from the beginning to ensure my design was adaptive across multiple screen sizes - This is extremely important in todays world as there is not one size fits all. 
* Media queries and designs have been implemented at different screen resolutions  to ensure the site is responsive at different sizes and can be used on any device.
    * Using Google Developer, I have tested each element of the site to ensure it responds to scaling.
        * For smartphones and Tablets I adapted the media queries to use smaller images, fonts and changed structures by using Flex-Directions. 
        * I grouped my elements as much as I could to reduce the amount of changes to the layout. I started my Media Queries at max 1250px which is around the industry standard size for desktop screns and worked my way down, until I got to smartphones with a Media Query set up for Min 0px and Max 480px. 
        * Seperating my Media Queries like this really helped as I tested the site scaling. Fortunately I have two screens t work from which meant not only could I code whilst using Google Developer, I can test the Site realtime using an Apple MacBook Screen and a HP Large Desktop Monitor Screen.

 
# Features:
### Landing Page (Home)
* Consistent interactive Header and Nav elements are used throughout the entire site.
    * The site has a Navigation bar accessible at all times, that blends in to the web page. It includes a link to the *Home*, *Community* and *Sign Up* pages.    
    * A simple Footer with links to *facebook*, *Email/Contact us* and *Sign Up* pages.

* Landing Page section -
    * An image of a football will instantly tell the user the sites main focus, giving it visual context to grab their attention.
    * The image has. text overlay with the Sites Name, a catchy slogan, and a location. Re-inforcing the reason the site exists and why the User is visiting.  
    * The image has an opacity value, to help blend the text and header.

    * There is a basic Map with Manchester circled, reminding the user of the sites taregteed locations
    * Adjacent to the Map are some Key Indicators of how many live games, members and Goals there is. This was to give the User a personal feel to the site, one where if they are a member they can contribute too.
* How Section -
    * I have created 3 large icons with a few words outlining how to use the site. 
    * the icons have a link to the corresponsing part of the site, with 'hover' styling to increase its size when a user hovers over them.
* Quote Section -
    * to give the site addiitonal context and personality, a quote from one of the members of the site has been added. This isn adjacent to a clear header.
    * The quote has a white background so it stands out, it in italic, and has a 'hover' styling.
    * Below this and in a mirror format for a visual pleasing secttion, I have added a large button for people to access the community from here, with the samer style ehader adjacent to it.



### Community Page (Second)
* Same consistent header and footer

* Avalable Games section -
    * This section has details of the available games. It is designed to be inclusive with an image of the games creator with details of the game.
    * Each game section has a border with a 3D effect to help it blend in. It has a white background to stand out, with three accessible buttons.
    * Each button has a link to the corresponsing part of the site.
        * Request to Join - Takes the user to the sign up page if they are not a member
        * Check Location - Takes the User to the Location section and its specific pitch location

* Location section - 
    * Background image of the football pitches that are specific to each available game. 
        * For this example, the background is indeed of the pitch, and players, of the available games. This gives the site personality and makes it relatebale to its members and users.
    * Embedded in the abckgroudn image are two divs containing Address Details and a Google Maps link.
        * The Address details have a transparent red background, following the color scheme of the site, with large and readable text.
        * For additional site functionality, there is also a Google Maps image of the location, which can be enlarged and followed on an external tab.

### Sign Up
* Same consistent header and footer

* Form Section - 
    * Kept simple and to the point, there is only once section for the Sign Up page.
        * It has a formal background image of a person in a suit writing down on paper on a desk. This image was chosen, as it reflects a football manager or player signing a football contract. So is relateable.
        * It is set at the same opacity as the landing page background image. This keeps theme consistency but also allows the form to be more visible.
    * The form method will be 'GET' and it will ask for **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email Address** and**Location** with a radio buttons of **Manchester** and **Other**.
