        <p><em>"Whenever you are relocating to a new area, making friends and getting involved in activities is never easy. Luckily, I lived in a group of flats that already had a Facebook Group set up. The site was born out of this group, with a member posting in asking if there would be anyone up for a game of 5-A-Side. The group grew, and the friendships with it. We have seen first hand the beenefit of bringing a group of random individuals together, inspired by football. <br>
              <br>
                Your 5-A-Side was created to promote this."</em></p>
